b. Ansys may, at its option (i) replace or modify the Program(s) so as to avoid infringement, (ii) procure the right for Customer to continue the use of the Program(s), or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) are commercially feasible, terminate any parts of the Program(s) impacted by the infringement claim.

The limitations on Ansys' liability set forth in this Section 8 shall also apply to the liability of Ansys' employees and directors, Affiliates (and their respective employees and directors), Channel Partners and technology suppliers, who may enforce the exclusions and limitations of liability in this Section 8 in their own name and for their own benefit.
f. The Program(s) constitute or are based on mathematical analysis tools intended to assist Customer in Customer's development and design processes.

10. Confidentiality
a. During the term of any mutual non-disclosure agreement in place between the parties governing the exchange of Confidential Information in the course of the provision of Program(s) to Customer, the provisions in this Section 8 do not apply. The obligations in this Section 8 shall apply for a period of three years from the date of first disclosure of any Confidential Information, except that Programs shall be kept confidential indefinitely.
b. The receiving party will protect Confidential Information from disclosure using no less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party shall not use the disclosing party's Confidential Information for purposes other than the exercise of its rights and the performance of its obligations under an Agreement.
